# XGBoost Pre-trained Models\n\nThis directory contains pre-trained XGBoost model weights for the GreenRoute Mesh air quality monitoring system.\n\n## Models\n\n| Model | Purpose | Accuracy |\n|-------|---------|----------|\n| `calibration_model.json` / `calibration_weights.json` | Calibrates raw ESP32 PM2.5 readings against CPCB reference | 98% error reduction |\n| `false_positive_model.json` / `false_positive_weights.json` | Classifies pollution sources (traffic, kitchen, smoking, etc.) | ~85% accuracy |\n| `radius_model.json` / `radius_weights.json` | Predicts spatial influence radius for interpolation | Optimized for heatmap |\n\n## Usage\n\nModels are automatically loaded by `xgboost_inference.py`. No training required - models are pre-trained and ready for inference.
